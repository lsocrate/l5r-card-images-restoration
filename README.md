# Bringing back L5R card images

This works by setting a custom stylesheet in your browser. It could be implemented as a browser extension, but I'm lazy and this is good enough.

## How to do it

1. [Save this file](https://github.com/lsocrate/l5r-card-images-restoration/raw/main/stylesheet.css) somewhere in your computer. This where all the replacements are defined.

2. Set that `.css` file as a custom stylesheet in your favorite browser.

3. Enjoy

## How to do it for the most common browsers

- Safari: https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/custom-style-sheet-in-safari/

- Firefox: https://www.frankindev.com/2020/08/01/custom-css-for-firefox/

- Chrome: Looks like you will need this https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb  
Also, stop using chrome. It's awful. Firefox and Edge are pretty good, Safari is great if you're on a Mac
